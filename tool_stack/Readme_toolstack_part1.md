# Tool stack

We are using in this tutorials (which reflect actually my best practices) some useful tools.

The idea behind it, is to have a complete workflow reflected.

## Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is our working horse to make container and run some of the tools isolated. We can create them, remove them, restart them, clean them, update them individually.


## MLflow

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) to keep track ouf our models over their live cycle.
We use mlflow to store our trained models, to call them from their container and use also some nice artifacts that we create and store there.

## SKlearn

[SKlearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to make "simple" models like regressions, random forests and so on.

## Pytorch

[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) is to make custom designed neural networks


## Plotly 

[Plotly](https://plotly.com/) is to make custom and intractive plots suiteable for dash applications.

## VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is to type and also execute the code. It is my personal preference. You don't need to stick to that. Feel free to use what ever you suites you best.

## Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is for python packages dependencies
