## Revising Knowledge and Optimal Strategies


At this point, you are confident that you have identified a number of Hot Xs. 
You involve your team members and a larger group of sales representatives for a open discussion of these findings.

There are several workshops and presentations and you collect good feedback from your collegues. 

Highlights:

- Need of more training in negotiation skills

- Need of more realistic sales management guidelines and price targets through a tailored price management process. A target of 5 % across the board is seen unrealistic and a more fine tuned approach makes more sense.

You consolidate your findings for a summary meeting with the management. You summarize the identified X from a combination of the data analysis and the sales representatives inputs into an Impact and Control Matrix.

The Impact axis is the relative size of the impact that an X has on overall process performance.
The Control axis relates to the degree of control or influence that can be exercised on this X through process redesign.

The *Supply Demand Balance* itself cannot be directly controlled but it can be controlled the timing to ensure that price increases are only attempted when the overall supply/demand balance is favorable, like in periods of relative shortage.


## Improvement Plan

Together with the management team you woked on an improvement plan focusing on 4 key areas:

- Product Category
- Sales Representative Training
- New Rules for Supply/Demand Balance Decisions
- Price Management Process Redesign

- Tactical Profit: 2.6 %
- Non Critical: 4.9 %

## Benefits:
