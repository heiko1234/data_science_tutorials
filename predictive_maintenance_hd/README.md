# Predictive Maintenance


## Data 

The original data can be downloaded from [backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html). The data from Q1/2016 - Q4/2016 are our training data. The testdata are Q2/2017.

The original data were cleaned and restructured.

* removed NaNs
* only most frequent drive models
* a dataframe was created


Data to predict failures a week in advance: df_2016_7.csv

Data to evaluate the final model on the data from 2017
