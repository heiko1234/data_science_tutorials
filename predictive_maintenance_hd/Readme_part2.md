# Predictive Maintenance

## Scenario

Imagine, you are Data Scientist and got the task to make a model for predicting if a HD will fail.

## Problem

For each HD there are several features measured every day. For each HD is also measured if it fails.

We have data for 2016 to train our model and like to run the model and use we test the model on data for 2017.


## Solution Idea

It is a typical classification problem. Either a HD will fail in the next 7 day or it will work. 

To predict a failure of a HD 7 days in advanced can be reagarded as predictive maintenance.



## Solution Design

First we will make a classification model based on data of 2016 for failures in 7 days in advanced.

Then we will take the time behavior and calculate some features for the data 10 days and 7 days in advanced.
