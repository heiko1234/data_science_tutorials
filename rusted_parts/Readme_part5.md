## App Design

![app_design](./assets/App_design.png)

We like to have an app with 2 or 3 Cards. 

The first Card will contain the possibility to upload an app / model config file from where the rest of the app is constructed.

At least the config file should contain the names of the models, and the models will generate the user inputs and the gauges and a table of the inputs and outputs.

So, lets make 3 cards:

- Upload Config File and User Inputs
- Table of Inputs and Outputs
- All Model Outputs as Gauge
