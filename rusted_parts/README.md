# Quality Improvements of Anodized Parts


## Setting the Szene

Your employer in a manufactuer of high end aluminium parts. 
The components are anodized to protect against corrosion and wear. The anodized parts are dyed to produce a smooth, rich and black surface to have a visually pleasing product surface.

In late 2014 the first problems with chronic discoloration have been reported.

Lot yield, determined by an outgoing visual inspection, ranges from 0 to 40 percent. 
There is a lot of rework and the on-time delivery of components is very poor. In addition, the quality of shipped components is often bad when assessed by the customer. 

Unless the aluminium part company cannot improve yield and optimize the quality, it may loose millions of dollars and the business with its major customer.


## A bit of chemistry

The anodizing process is referred to as a Type II anodization, where the anodizin is done in a sulfuric acid bath. The parts are suspended in the acid bath and a direct current is appplied in such a way that the parts become the anodes of an electrolytic cell. Oxygen is generated on the surfaces of the aluminium parts, causing a building of aluminium oxide . The parameters used in the anodizing process not only have a significant mpact on the coating thinckness but also affect the shape and size of pores that form in the coating. This in turn affects the ability of the anodized surface to retain dye or other coatings.


## Team 

You are alone.

There is no Team around you.


## Defining the Process

Producing an anodized aluminium part is complex with several steps. 

Several possible variables on each process step have been identified.

4 Quality Aspects: 
- CIELAB (L*, a*, b*)
- coating thinckness

## Framing the Problem

Currently, the black anodizing process has very low daily yields, usually below 40 % and aerging 19 %. This results in high scrap and rework costs. 
Also, the largst customer is threatening to find another supplier if quality and on-time delivery are not substantially improved. 
In the past 6 months, scrap and rework costs have totaled approximately 450 k€ with on-time delivery below 60 %.

## KPI

Improve the black anodized process yield from 19 % to  minium of 90 % (in 6 month).
This KPI is the lot-by-lot yield. 


## Scope

The project will address only the black anodizing process. All other manufacturing steps are out of scope for this project.
