# Polymer Improvement Part 2

## Next steps

After you checked the Yield, you decide to concentrate on the polymer plant and set a goal for this Trouble shooting task.

You know that if you eliminate the crises, a 94 % average yield is achivable while you believe you can do better 95 % is your personal target.

### Goal: Yield up to 94 %


To understand the process a bit better you do a small SIPOC and a VOC of the process.

## SIPOC

## VOC (Voice of the customer)

You decide to draw a *Critical to Quality Tree* to tacke the critical customer needs and their drivers to finally go to the measurabe requirements that are needed for improvements.

### Down-stream plan requirements:

- MFI between 192 - 198 (target: 195)
- maximum possible CI value is 100, but CI must exceed a lower specification limit of 80


## Historical Data of former Crisis Teams

Earlier Teams were unable to identify the root cause of the crisis. 

You and your Team begin to review the last crisis team's data and analysis. You find an *Input/Output process map* (similar to a flow chart or an simple PID charts). The former TEAM already labeld 3Ys and 8Xs of special interest.

You find a table with these information under [Link](). 
There is no explicit time column, only the *Batch number* define the process order.
