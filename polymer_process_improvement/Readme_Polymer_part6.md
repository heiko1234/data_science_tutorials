# Polymer Improvement Part 6

## Knowledge Implementation

Based on the 2 models for MFI and CI you build a Dash App for visualization. You can follow the tutorial for the "Simple Dash App".


You discuss with your collegues and the process managers of the plants. 

Based on the simulations and predictions of the models, you agree on running the plants an specific set points:

- SA: 64.5
- Xf: 15.12 (%)

After a few test runs you and your team realizes that the process vary around and will have a Standard Deviation of:

- SA: 1.9
- Xf: 0.4


## Track Improvements

Very old fashin but still useful are control charts to verify the process improvements from the old process to the process with new and very narrowed setpoints of SA and Xf and the monitoring of MFI and CI.


## Project Summary

The original project goal was to eliminate the periods of crisis with a goal of achieving a yiled rate of 95 %. 

With all the challenges in between the project was extended and after one year of the implementation of the controlled new setpoints the issue seem to be solved. A few batches from time to time slightly fall below the specification limit and gets blended with better ones. The overall yield between upstream and downstream plant is close to 100 %.
The target **KPI**s like *MFI* and *CI* are very narrow monitored and with in its specification limits.

### Project savings: 
- 750 k€ / year for not rejected batches anymore.
- 2.100 k€ / year for no more process restrictions and not planed process interruptions in the downstream production

### Cost: 
- The actual costs for the process improvements are very small
- The costs for project initiation were around 100 k€ which include the developing of the app, equipment and analytical methode replacing, working time of project leader and team members


### Key Lessons: 
- Do not trust a measurement system. Only the improvement of 2 key measurements give meaningful results for the analysis.
- The DMAIC methodolgy and the usage of Six Sigma give a high level of process understanding.
- Visual Six Sigma combined with modern Techniques for analysis solve problems effectively.


# Key learnings of this tutorial
- Brief Knowledge how a project can run
- Get a first understanding of problems within a project
- Get familiar with Tools like MLFlow, Python packages like sklearn and plotly in a project workflow
